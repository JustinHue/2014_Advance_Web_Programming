			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Hi! I am Justin Hellsten. I would be what you call a hobbyist programmer. On my spare time I love to work on personal projects or learn something new in programming. Most of my projects revolve mostly around making and designing games or webites, but I am open to working on projects in other areas. I am currently a student studying at Georgian College for the Computer Programming Analyst program and working in co-ops between academic semesters through Georgian College's internship program.</p>
		<p>If you want to know more about my projects you can check out my portfolio page or view the source code on Github. If you're an employer you can check out my skills, expertise and work experience on my Linkedin profile.</p>

			<h2>Video Games!</h2>
		</header>
		<p>One of my hobbies include playing video games. Whenever I get tired of coding or if I am mentally destroyed from a long day at work I enjoy playing video games to relax and recover. The main video games I play are Starcraft 2, League of Legends and Team Fortress 2, but I am not limited to just these games. I am generally available online through the steam or skype client and will mostly communicate to friends there during my gaming sessions.</p>
		<p>I am a very competitive Starcraft 2 and League of Legends gamer. I am currently ranked masters in Starcraft 2 and placed silver in League of Legends. I have been playing Starcraft 2 since Wings of Liberty beta 2010 and have continue to play in Heart of the Swarm. However lately I have taken more interest and focus on League of Legends. My alias name on the internet is Pyrue (Starcraft 2) or TPZMaster (League of Legends). The name Pyrue is a manifest of my fascination for the Pyro class in Team Fortress 2 and TPZMaster was a lame attempt to call myself the "Terran Protoss Zerg Master". If you're interested you can check out my Starcraft profile here.</p>
		<p>There are so many other games I enjoy playing in when I was a younger it would be hard to put them all in a list, but for the record, some of my most favorite and nostalgic games are:</p>
		<ul>
    			<li>Final Fantasy Series 1-7, Mystic Quest</li>
    			<li>Bomberman Series</li>
    			<li>Chrono Trigger</li>
    			<li>Robotrek</li>
    			<li>Terranigma</li>
    			<li>Earth Bound</li>
    			<li>Hocus Pocus</li>
    			<li>Jill</li>
    			<li>Jazz Rabbit</li>
    			<li>Pokemon R/B/Y/Silver</li>
    			<li>Whiplash</li>
    			<li>...and this list goes on</li>
