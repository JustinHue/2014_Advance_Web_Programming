        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>Hi! I am Justin Hellsten. I would be what you call a hobbyist programmer. On my spare time I love to work  on personal projects or learn something new in programming. Most of my projects revolve mostly around making and designing games or webites, but I am open to working on projects in other areas. I am currently a student studying at Georgian College for the Computer Programming Analyst program and working in co-ops between academic semesters through Georgian College's internship program.</p>

    <h1>Video Games...</h1>
    <p>One of my hobbies include playing video games. Whenever I get tired of coding or if I am mentally destroyed from a long day at work I enjoy playing video games to relax and recover. The main video games I play are Starcraft 2, League of Legends and Team Fortress 2, but I am not limited to just these games. I am generally available online through the steam or skype client and will mostly communicate to friends there during my gaming sessions.</p> 
    
    <p>I am a very competitive Starcraft 2 and League of Legends gamer. I am currently ranked masters in Starcraft 2 and placed silver in League of Legends. I have been playing Starcraft 2 since Wings of Liberty beta 2010 and have continue to play in Heart of the Swarm. However lately I have taken more interest and focus on League of Legends. My alias name on the internet is Pyrue (Starcraft 2) or TPZMaster (League of Legends). The name Pyrue is a manifest of my fascination for the Pyro class in Team Fortress 2 and TPZMaster was a lame attempt to call myself the "Terran Protoss Zerg Master". If you're interested you can check out my Starcraft profile <a href="http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/profile/552172/1/Pyrue/">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>There are so many other games I enjoy playing in when I was a younger it would be hard to put them all in a list, but for the record, some of my most favorite and nostalgic games are:</p>
            
    <ul>
        <li><a href="">Final Fantasy Series 1-7, Mystic Quest</a></li>        
        <li><a href="">Bomberman Series</a></li>

        <li><a href="">Robotrek</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Terranigma</a></li>
