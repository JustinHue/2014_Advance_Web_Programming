            <p>I am not sure how to start this as this is the first time I made a blog. I hope I am not a complete bore and if you're an actual person reading this, god forbid. The whole point of my website is to serve as a portfolio to employers to see what I am capable of doing. I am in a co-op program at Georgian College and I need some way to show case my programming projects whether it be making websites, apps or video games. Maybe in the future I can expand this site into something more interesting but at this point in time it will serve as a portfolio website. I already added my Ritz pygame project and other small javascript applications to my portfolio section, and I plan on adding more projects soon. I am a bit in the mood to make games so I will probably code a couple of games to show case in the near future. I will most likely not delve into anything web related as I get enough web programming at my current co-op placement. </p>
