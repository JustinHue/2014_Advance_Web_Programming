		<h1>What up world!</h1>
		<p>Being the passionate gamer and programmer that I am I push towards making the best games, applications and websites.</p>
		<p>This website serves as a place to show the world what I am capable of doing and what I am doing. I enjoy making games, apps or websites and I will share the things I have done on this website. The projects shown on this website will be school related or things I have done on my own time, and will most likely be showcased here along with the source code through download links or github. If you are an employer and are impress in what you see you can contact me at justinhellsten@gmail.com or through the various social networks you can find on my "Keep Connected" panel.</p>
