                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
		<p>I am Justin Hellsten. I would be what you call a hobbyist programmer. On my spare time I love to work on personal projects or learn something new in programming. Most of my projects revolve mostly around making and designing games or webites, but I am open to working on projects in other areas. I am currently a student studying at Georgian College for the Computer Programming Analyst program and working in co-ops between academic semesters through Georgian College's internship program. I have several co-ops under my belt, including working at King Brand Healthcare as the Web Programmer and working at Avetti Commerce as Web Designer. I am very well adapt in developing websites, games and apps, my most strongest languages being HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL in the web programming realm and C++ and Python in game programming. Other languages that I also know are Python and C#. </p>
